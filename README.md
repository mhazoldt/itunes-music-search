## iTunes Music Search
This is one of the earlier projects from The Iron Yard. It is plain HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The only thing added to it is icons.

The search data is from the [iTunes affiliate API](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/).


## Libraries Used
